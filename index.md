I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering at Georgia Tech. My research thesis focuses on integrating planning decisions with operations scheduling in trucking service networks. I am currently working with <a href="https://www.isye.gatech.edu/users/alan-erera/">Dr. Alan Erera</a> and <a href="https://www.isye.gatech.edu/users/pascal-van-hentenryck">Dr. Pascal Van Hentenryck</a>under the
<a href="https://www.ai4opt.org/">AI4OPT</a> program. I am leading efforts in developing the state-of-the-art methodology for solving large scale tactical load planning problems using learning-based optimization proxies. Our major contribution is developing an automated capacity planning and scheduling tool for a large U.S. parcel carrier.

I completed my undergraduate degree from IIT Kharagpur, with a B.Tech in Industrial and Systems Engineering. My B. Tech thesis was based on Risk Propagation in Supply Chain Networks under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=xDL-rrsAAAAJ&hl=en/">Prof. M. K. Tiwari.</a> Next, I worked as an Operations Research consultant at TCG Digital, Kolkata.
