As a Ph.D. student in <strong>Operations Research</strong> in the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering at <strong>Georgia Tech</strong>, I am pushing the research boundary in terms of theory and practice in the area of logistics and supply chain. My thesis centers on integrating planning decisions with operations scheduling in <strong>trucking service networks</strong>. 

Working with esteemed professors <a href="https://www.isye.gatech.edu/users/alan-erera/">Dr. Alan Erera</a> and <a href="https://www.isye.gatech.edu/users/pascal-van-hentenryck">Dr. Pascal Van Hentenryck</a> under the <a href="https://www.ai4opt.org/">AI4OPT</a> program, I'm leading efforts in conducting cutting-edge research to solve large-scale *tactical load planning* problems using *learning-based optimization proxies*. 

I completed my undergraduate degree from the <strong>Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur</strong>, with a B.Tech in Industrial and Systems Engineering. My undergraduate thesis was based on *Risk Propagation in Supply Chain Networks* under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=xDL-rrsAAAAJ&hl=en/">Dr. M. K. Tiwari.</a> Next, I worked as an Operations Research consultant at TCG Digital, Kolkata.
