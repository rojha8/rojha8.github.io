I am working as a Research Scientist in the Last Mile Science team at Amazon.

I defended my PhD thesis on <strong>Advances in Tactical Planning Decision Problems in Trucking Service Networks</strong>. My thesis was supervised by my advisor <strong>Dr. Alan Erera</strong> at ISyE <strong>Georgia Tech</strong>.

I completed my undergraduate degree from the <strong>Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur</strong>, with a B.Tech in <strong>Industrial and Systems Engineering</strong>. My undergraduate thesis was based on *Risk Propagation in Supply Chain Networks* under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=xDL-rrsAAAAJ&hl=en/">Dr. M. K. Tiwari.</a> Next, I worked as an Operations Research consultant at TCG Digital, Kolkata.
