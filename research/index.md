My research interest is in the broad area of Large Scale Optimization. I have been exploring decomposition techniques and heuristic algorithms, under the guidance of <a href="https://www.isye.gatech.edu/users/natashia-boland/">Prof. N. Boland,</a> to deal with difficult-to-solve Integer programs arising in Scheduling optimization.
