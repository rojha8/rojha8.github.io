I specialize in developing exact and heuristic algorithms for large-scale optimization problems in transportation and logistics networks. 

### Interests

Network Design and Scheduling, Supply Chain Optimization, Data-driven Optimization, Integer Programming, Learning-based Decomposition Techniques for Large Scale Service Networks

<!-- My work encompasses a range of challenging problems, including <strong>trailer scheduling</strong>, <strong>trailer lease planning</strong>, <strong>flow and load planning</strong>, and <strong>service network design</strong>. As a passionate integer programmer, I relish the challenge of devising effective and *implementable* mathematical solutions, using <strong>data-driven heuristics</strong> and <strong>decomposition</strong> methods. Through my work, I help transportation and logistics companies to optimize their service network operations and improve efficiency. -->
