I specialize in developing exact and heuristic algorithms for <strong>large-scale optimization</strong> problems in transportation and logistics networks. My work encompasses a range of challenging problems, including <strong>truck scheduling</strong>, <strong>trailer lease planning</strong>, <strong>flow and load planning</strong>, and <strong>network design</strong>. As a passionate integer programmer, I relish the challenge of devising effective and *implementable* mathematical solutions, using <strong>data-driven heuristics</strong> and <strong>decomposition</strong> methods. Through my work, I help transportation and logistics companies to optimize their service network operations and improve efficiency.
