I am a PhD student in Operations Research at ISyE Georgia Tech. I develop exact and heuristic algorithms for large scale optimization problems arising in transportation and logistics networks: trucks scheduling, trailer leasing, flow and load planning, network design. I am passionate about integer programming and enjoy developing model formulations. My thesis is supervised by <a href="https://www.isye.gatech.edu/users/alan-erera/">Prof. Alan Erera</a> and my research is funded by a large parcel carrier in US.

Under the <a href="https://www.ai4opt.org/">AI4OPT</a> program, I am leading efforts in developing the state-of-the-art methodology for solving large scale tactical load planning problems for trucking companies. This work is in collaboration with <a href="https://www.isye.gatech.edu/users/pascal-van-hentenryck">Prof. Pascal Van Hentenryck</a>.

I completed my undergraduate degree from IIT Kharagpur, with a B.Tech in Industrial and Systems Engineering. My B. Tech thesis was based on Risk Propagation in Supply Chain Networks under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=xDL-rrsAAAAJ&hl=en/">Prof. M. K. Tiwari.</a> Next, I worked as an Operations Research consultant at TCG Digital, Kolkata.
